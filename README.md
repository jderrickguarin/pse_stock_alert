# PSE Stock Alert 
A simple Python app that alerts the user of PSE-listed stock to buy or sell given an indicator.

Long-term goal for this project is to develop a web app that sends a client detailed recommendation and report of their particular stocks watchlist. Medium-term goal is to deploy this to a personal Linux server, probably the likes of Raspberry Pi or a dedicated machine running Ubuntu. 

For now, `stock_data_reader.py` should be integrated to other files, rewrite most functions to handle continuous script running and more.
